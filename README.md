# Python-ML-and-Problem-Solving
This repository show cases some of my machine learning projects as well as some problem solving I have done using python. The final_group_project.ipynb 
is a problem revolving around making predictions using the GooglePlay data set found on Kaggle.com. We implemented predictive analytic techniques and several 
machine learning algorithms to accurately predict if an app would be free or not free. The Heart_failure_final.ipynb file is my first attempt at using machine learning techniques
to make predictions. The document labeled RyilieFleckensteinQuiz4.docx shows a visualization of a Suppport Vector Machine (SVM) and was coded using the R programming language.
