# Python-ML-and-Problem-Solving
This repository show cases some of my machine learning projects as well as some problem solving I have done using python. The final_group_project.ipynb 
is a problem revolving around making predictions using the GooglePlay data set found on Kaggle.com. We implemented predictive analytic techniques and several 
machine learning algorithms to accurately predict if an app would be free or not free. The Heart_failure_final.ipynb file is my first attempt at using machine learning techniques
to make predictions. The document labeled RyilieFleckensteinQuiz4.docx shows a visualization of a Suppport Vector Machine (SVM) and was coded using the R programming language.
The hacker_rank file showcases some python problem solving that I did through the hackerrank.com website.
The Sudoku file showcases my implementation of a sudoku solver that I created using python. I wanted to practice implementing some Object Oriented Programming and decided making a Solver() class in python that can be used to solve any solvable sudoku puzzle would be fun. Some of the logic was adapted from this website https://towardsdatascience.com/solve-sudokus-automatically-4032b2203b64 but the object oriented implementation was designed by me along with parts of the logic.
